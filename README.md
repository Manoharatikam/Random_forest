## problem statement:
A American based botnical garden grow iris flower in ther lab but using bio technology in a singal tree differnt type of variety flower is grow as datascience engineer find out how much aacuracy is ther all categeries contain same specias.
Task1: preprocess the data in skit.learn library
Task2:Load the data using sklearn model selection deffult argument
Task3: On the baese of your dataset train test and split your svm model
Task4:impliment support vector mechanism clasifier using svm_classifier.The svm must be "Linear"
Task5:Train the classifier on the training data
Task6:findout the prediction value on the test data
Task7:Testthe model with the help of accurecy,accuracy should lie in range of 0-1
